The goal of cst is to provide easy climate data access ([MACA
v2](http://www.climatologylab.org/maca.html)) to support climate
scenario planning. This package allows you to:

1.  Quickly acquire climate data subsets for a spatial region of
    interest, with first class support for US National Parks
2.  Summarize climate data at daily timesteps, and compute derived
    quantities
3.  Contrast reference and target time periods to understand differences
    in climate over time, and
4.  Easily work with climate data, without having to worry about the
    details of how it is stored or formatted

## Installation

Install the development version of cst from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("earthlab/cst")
```

This package also has some python dependencies. We recommend using conda
(preferably [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
to simplify the installation process. Python dependencies can be
installed as follows:

``` r
cst::install_py_deps()
```

## Quickstart guide

To acquire daily precipitation data for Acadia National Park for a
subset of climate models, you can use the `cstdata()` function:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(cst)

d <- cstdata(park = "Acadia National Park", parameters = "pr", 
             years = c(2020, 2021), models = "CCSM4", scenarios = "rcp85")
#> [1] "Retrieving Area of Interest Boundaries"
#> [1] "Retrieving climate data for acadia_national_park"
#> [1] "Saving local files to /tmp/RtmppZXyFr/acadia_national_park"
```

This gives you a data frame with paths to local climate data files:

``` r
str(d)
#> Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    1 obs. of  12 variables:
#>  $ local_file    : chr "pr_acadia_national_park_CCSM4_r6i1p1_rcp85_macav2metdata_2020_2021_daily.nc"
#>  $ local_path    : chr "/tmp/RtmppZXyFr/acadia_national_park/pr_acadia_national_park_CCSM4_r6i1p1_rcp85_macav2metdata_2020_2021_daily.nc"
#>  $ model         : chr "CCSM4"
#>  $ parameter     : chr "pr"
#>  $ rcp           : chr "rcp85"
#>  $ ensemble      : chr "r6i1p1"
#>  $ year1         : num 2020
#>  $ year2         : num 2021
#>  $ area_name     : chr "acadia_national_park"
#>  $ units         : chr "mm"
#>  $ full_var_name : chr "Precipitation"
#>  $ parameter_long: chr "precipitation"
```

And, you can also summarize the daily data by computing a spatial
average over the region of interest:

``` r
df <- cst_df(d, cores = 2)
#> Computing spatial averages...
#> Generating climate data.frame...
str(df)
#> Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    731 obs. of  6 variables:
#>  $ rcp      : chr  "rcp85" "rcp85" "rcp85" "rcp85" ...
#>  $ date     : Date, format: "2020-01-01" "2020-01-02" ...
#>  $ model    : chr  "CCSM4" "CCSM4" "CCSM4" "CCSM4" ...
#>  $ ensemble : chr  "r6i1p1" "r6i1p1" "r6i1p1" "r6i1p1" ...
#>  $ area_name: chr  "acadia_national_park" "acadia_national_park" "acadia_national_park" "acadia_national_park" ...
#>  $ pr       : num  0 6.4 0 16.8 16.4 ...
```

Because this is a data.frame, you can use all of the normal data
visualization and processing functionality in R, e.g.,

``` r
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, pr)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(alpha = .1) + 
  xlab("Date") + 
  ylab("Precipitation (mm)") + 
  ggtitle("Acadia National Park, CCSM4, RCP 8.5")
```
