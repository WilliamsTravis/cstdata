The goal of cst is to provide data access utilities that facilitate
climate scenario planning

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("earthlab/cst")
```

## Example

To acquire precipitation data for Acadia National Park for a subset of
climate models, you can use the `cstdata` function:

``` r
library(cst)
library(raster)

d <- cstdata(park = "Acadia National Park", parameters = "pr", 
             years = c(2020, 2021), models = "CCSM4", scenarios = "rcp85")
```
