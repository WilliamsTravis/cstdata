# Welcome to the Climate Future Toolbox's Available Data function

This vignette provides a walk-through of a common use case of the Available Data function and the cft package:
understanding climate futures for a region of interest. 
We'll use Hot Springs National Park, located in Arkansas, USA and Yellowstone National Park, located in Wyoming, USA, as case studies.

### What you'll learn

This vignette will show you how to: 

- Access climate data for a spatial region of interest
- Produce a `data.frame` containing climate data
- Visualize historical and future data
- Generate and analyze new climate variables

### What you'll need

To get the most out of this vignette, we assume you have: 

- At least 500 MB of disk space
- Some familiarity with ggplot2
- Some familiarity with dplyr (e.g., [`filter()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/filter), [`group_by()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/group_by), and [`summarise()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/summarise))

## About the data

Global Circulation Models (GCMs) provide estimates of historical and future 
climate conditions. 
The complexity of the climate system has lead to a large number GCMs and it is
common practice to examine outputs from many different models, treating each as 
one plausible future.

Most GCMs are spatially coarse (often 1 degree), but downscaling provides finer
scale estimates. The cft package uses one downscaled climate model called MACA 
(Multivariate Adaptive Climate Analog) Version 2 
([details here](http://www.climatologylab.org/maca.html)).

### Acquiring and subsetting data within National Park Service boundaries

This package was originally written with the National Park Service in mind, so
it has the option to use the name of any park (or monument, preserve, etc.) within
the NPS. Use the `cftdata()` function to specify a range of years, a set of models,
a set of parameters, and a set of representative concentration pathways to return. 
Leaving these arguments empty will result in a download of all available data 
for that location.

# Loading the cft package from github
```{r install cft, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("earthlab/cft")
```

## Attach cft and check the list of available functions
```{r}
library(cft)
ls(pos="package:cft")
```

# Use read-only mode to find available data without initiating a full download.
```{r}
inputs <- cft::available_data()

```

## Look at the documentation for those functions
```{r}
?available_data
?single_point_firehose
```

Look at the variables, emission scenarios, and models for which data are available
```{r}
levels(as.factor(inputs$variable_names$Variable))
levels(as.factor(inputs$variable_names$`Variable abbreviation`))

levels(as.factor(inputs$variable_names$Scenario))
levels(as.factor(inputs$variable_names$`Scenario abbreviation`))

levels(as.factor(inputs$variable_names$Model))
levels(as.factor(inputs$variable_names$`Model abbreviation`))
```

This code downloads data for all models, all emission scenarios, and 5 climate variables.  Notice that this is a large download request.  
```{r}
input_variables <- inputs$variable_names %>% 
  filter(Variable %in% c("Maximum Relative Humidity",

# Establish area of interst (AOI) by bounding box
You will need to specify an appropriate area of interest for downloading spatial data. We utilize the functionality of open street map to make it fast and easy to download shapefiles for any area of interest. Here I am using the open street map (OSM) protocol to retrieve a shapefile for Hot Springs National Park. I choice this park because it is the smallest national park. 

This chunk of code is first using the [getbb()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/osmdata/versions/0.1.9/topics/getbb) function to retrieve a bounding box matching a plain language search request. That bounding box is then fed into the API call that retrieves the data and converts it into an r-specific spatial data format called sf.

OSM uses a 'key' and 'value' system for organizing requests. You may want to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the immense library of data you can access with this system. https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags
```{r bounding box small, cache=TRUE}
bb <- getbb("Hot Springs")
my_boundary <- opq(bb) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "boundary", value = "national_park") %>% 
osmdata_sf() 

my_boundary
```

Here you re-calibrate the bounding box relative to the actual shapefiles you downloaded. The bounding box above was pulled from the osm database, this bounding box is for the polygons you actually used. These two boxes may be the same or they may be different but the one derived from your downloaded shapefile is reproducible. 

Notice that we specify osm_multipolygons instead of osm_polygons. This is a case-specific choice. When you download a shapefile from OSM, if will include a number of different spatial object types and you can choose several of those options to move forward. We chose multipolygons because they best matched our area of interest. Use the quick plot below to visualize your area of interest before continuing. 
```{r pulled bounding box small, cache=TRUE}
boundaries <- my_boundary$osm_multipolygons
pulled_bb <- st_bbox(boundaries)
pulled_bb
```

This quick map allows you to check that the polygon you downloaded matches your expectations. 
```{r plot of area of interest small, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8}
basemap <- ggplot(data = boundaries) +
  geom_sf(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_sf_text(aes(label = boundaries$name)) 

basemap
```

# Download full time series from a single point
WARNING: TIME CONSUMING STEPS AHEAD

It's time to download. Here is a simple and fast example of data from a single point (the centroid of our polygon) for one year (2099). On our local machine this takes ~3 minutes. 

```{r pull data for single point for one year, eval=TRUE}
start_time <- Sys.time()

center_point <- st_centroid(boundaries) %>% st_bbox(center_point)
times <- inputs$available_times

Pulled_data_single_space_single_timepoint <- inputs$src %>% 
  hyper_filter(lat = lat <= c(center_point[4]+0.05) & lat >= c(center_point[2]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(lon = lon <= c(center_point[3]+0.05) & lon >= c(center_point[1]-0.05)) %>%
  hyper_filter(time = times$`Available times` ==  44558) %>% 
  hyper_tibble(select_var = input_variables[1:38]) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326, agr = "constant") 

end_time <- Sys.time()
print(end_time - start_time)

head(Pulled_data_single_space_single_timepoint)
```

If you try to download a large quantity of data, you will likely get the following error:
Error note: an error like this is likely a connection error. Try again. Sometime you need to restart your R session to clear memory.
"curl error details: 
Error in R_nc4_open: NetCDF: I/O failure
Error in ncdf4::nc_open(x$source$source[1]) : 
  Error in nc_open trying to open file https://cida.usgs.gov/thredds/dodsC/macav2metdata_daily_future"
  
This error occurs when you try to download too much data using the available_data() function.  If you are downloading a large quantity of data, you should use the firehose() function in the cft package instead of the available_data() function.  Running the code in the following code chunk will likely produce this error.    
  
Here we remove the time filter to download all the requested input variables for the entire timeperiod.

NOTE: When you ask for a big download, that may exceed the API limit, the API asks you to confirm that you want to try. This will prompt a YES/NO question in your console that you need to answer if you want to continue. If you find this step taking a very long time, check that your console isn't waiting for you to confirm that you want to try this request. 

```{r pull data for single point for all years, eval=FALSE}
start_time <- Sys.time()
center_point <- st_centroid(boundaries) %>% st_bbox(center_point)

Pulled_data_single_space_all_timepoints <- inputs$src %>% 
  hyper_filter(lat = lat <= c(center_point[4]+0.05) & lat >= c(center_point[2]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(lon = lon <= c(center_point[3]+0.05) & lon >= c(center_point[1]-0.05)) %>%
  hyper_filter(time = times$`Available times` ==  44558) %>% 
  hyper_tibble(select_var = input_variables) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326, agr = "constant")

end_time <- Sys.time()
print(end_time - start_time)

head(Pulled_data_single_space_all_timepoints)
```

## Error when you try to download too much data at one time
  This is where you will start seeing error returned from the API if you have requested too much data at one time. 
  
  Downloads from the API are limited to 500 MB per request. A request for a large area of interest combined with a long time series will return a cryptic runtime error informing you that your request was too large.

This error may look like this:
"CURL Error: Transferred a partial file
Error in Rsx_nc4_get_vara_int: NetCDF: DAP failure
Var: pr_CCSM4_r6i1p1_rcp85 Ndims: 3 Start: 0,444,511 Count: 34333,2,3
Error in ncvar_get_inner(ncid2use, varid2use, nc$var[[li]]$missval, addOffset, :
C function Rsx_nc4_get_var_int returned error"

The solution to this problem is to subset your requests to make them fit within the boundaries of the API. You can achieve this by balancing the size of your requested spatial extent and the length of your requested time period. For a small national park, it's possible to pull the entire time series from the API but larger parks will require you to request shorter time window or stitch multiple time windows together.  


## Filter time
Time is one of the easiest dimensions to filter along because the time data are organized by sequential number, so they are easy to cut up and reassemble without needing to reference outside tables. The request filter is sensitive to vector length, so we build in our filter indexes into the time dataframe to insure that they are all the same length. 

Here we are adding a generic index filled with 0's that we can use in the future, a column with 1's for the first half and 0's for the second half, and a column with 0's for the first half and 1's for the second. 
```{r filter time for single poing with error, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(tibble)

# Year 2034
time_min <- 38716
time_max <- 73048

input_times <- inputs$available_times %>% 
  add_column(index = 0) %>% 
  add_column(first_half = 0) %>% 
  add_column(second_half = 0) 
input_times[which(inputs$available_times[,1] >= time_min & inputs$available_times[,1] <= time_max ),3] <- 1

med <- median(row_number(input_times[,3])) 
input_times[which(as.numeric(row.names(input_times)) <= med),4] <- 1
input_times[which(as.numeric(row.names(input_times)) > med),5] <- 1

tail(input_times)
```

## Download full time series as a set of smaller downloads
When your data request is too big for a single API request, it will need to be cut it into smaller requests. You can use the new index columns we created in the time table above to cut our single request into two requests. This leaves you with two data tables instead of one. You can bind these two tables back together, but it is time consuming to do so because the two tables have to take turns writing themselves to a new third table that they can occupy together. This takes a lot of short term memory and errors out some machines. It will save you time and effort if you can avoid binding them back together. 
```{r stitch_pull for single poing, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

Pulled_data_sub1 <- Pulled_data <- inputs$src %>% 
  hyper_filter(lat = lat <= c(center_point[4]+0.05) & lat >= c(center_point[2]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(lon = lon <= c(center_point[3]+0.05) & lon >= c(center_point[1]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(time =  input_times[,4] == 1) %>% 
  hyper_tibble(select_var = input_variables
    )

Pulled_data_sub2 <- Pulled_data <- inputs$src %>% 
  hyper_filter(lat = lat <= c(center_point[4]+0.05) & lat >= c(center_point[2]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(lon = lon <= c(center_point[3]+0.05) & lon >= c(center_point[1]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(time =  input_times[,5] == 1) %>% 
  hyper_tibble(select_var = input_variables
    )

tail(Pulled_data_sub1)
tail(Pulled_data_sub2)
```


# Expanding to include a large area of interest
In the previous examples, we pulled data from a single point in the center of a small national park. Now, we will show you how to download, analyze, and visualize these data over a large spatial extent.

First, we will redefine our area of interest to include all the national parks that touch Yellowstone National Park. OSM provides a bounding box just like we used above for Hot Springs, Arkansas.  However, the bounding box provided by OSM for the national parks that touch Yellowstone National Park is larger than the official bounding box provided by the national parks service.  In the following code, we start by obtaining the bounding box from OSM and then manually adjust the corners of that bounding box to match the official bounding box from the national parks service. 
```{r bounding box large, cache=TRUE}
bb <- getbb("yellowstone")

bb_manual <- bb
bb_manual[1,1] <- -111.15594815937659
bb_manual[1,2] <- -109.8305463801207
bb_manual[2,1] <- 44.12354048271325
bb_manual[2,2] <- 45.11911641599412

my_boundary_yellow <- opq(bb_manual) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "boundary", value = "national_park") %>% 
osmdata_sf() 

my_boundary_yellow

boundaries_large <- my_boundary_yellow$osm_multipolygons
pulled_bb_large <- st_bbox(boundaries_large)
pulled_bb_large
```

Let's do another quickplot to make sure our area of interest matches our expectations. 
```{r plot of area of interest large, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8}
basemap <- ggplot(data = boundaries_large) +
  geom_sf(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_sf_text(aes(label = boundaries_large$name)) 

basemap
```

## Large area with few variables
  As your area of interest expands, you will need to cut you time and variable requests to accommodate more spatial points. Here we have cut our variables down to just "Precipitation", our scenarios down to just "RCP 8.5", and our models down to just "Model for Interdisciplinary Research On Climate 5"
```{r filter variables few, cache=TRUE}
input_variables <- inputs$variable_names %>% 
  filter(Variable %in% c( "Precipitation")) %>% 
  filter(Scenario %in% c( "RCP 8.5")) %>% 
  filter(Model %in% c(
             
 "Model for Interdisciplinary Research On Climate 5" )) %>%
  
  pull("Available variable")

input_variables
```


# Download data by AOI, filtered times, and filtered variable list
```{r pulled data for small area, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Pulled_data_large_area_few_variables <- inputs$src %>% 
  hyper_filter(lat = lat <= c(pulled_bb_large[4]+0.05) & lat >= c(pulled_bb_large[2]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(lon = lon <= c(pulled_bb_large[3]+0.05) & lon >= c(pulled_bb_large[1]-0.05)) %>%
  hyper_filter(time = input_times$`Available times` ==  73048) %>% 
  hyper_tibble(select_var = input_variables
    ) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326, agr = "constant")


head(Pulled_data_large_area_few_variables)
tail(Pulled_data_large_area_few_variables)
```

### Time extent plot
Check this plot to make sure you downloaded your entire time series. 
```{r plot pulled data for small area, eval=FALSE}
plot(Pulled_data_large_area_few_variables$time, Pulled_data_large_area_few_variables$`pr_MIROC5_r1i1p1_rcp85`)
```

### Spatial extent plot
Check here to make sure you downloaded the proper spatial extent. 
```{r check pulled data for large area, cache=TRUE, fig.height=8, eval=TRUE}
check_filter <- Pulled_data_large_area_few_variables %>% filter(time == min(Pulled_data_large_area_few_variables$time))

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = boundaries_large, fill = "cornflowerblue") +
 geom_sf(data = check_filter, color = "red", size=0.5) +
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) 
```

## If you encounter an error suggesting that you are pulling too much data, you will need to stitch a few requests together to keep each call below the 500 MB limit. 

```{r stitch_pull for large area, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Pulled_data_sub1 <- inputs$src %>% 
  hyper_filter(lat = lat <= c(pulled_bb[4]+0.05) & lat >= c(pulled_bb[2]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(lon = lon <= c(pulled_bb[3]+0.05) & lon >= c(pulled_bb[1]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(time =  input_times[,4] == 1) %>% 
  hyper_tibble(select_var = input_variables) %>%  
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326, agr = "constant")

Pulled_data_sub2 <- inputs$src %>% 
  hyper_filter(lat = lat <= c(pulled_bb[4]+0.05) & lat >= c(pulled_bb[2]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(lon = lon <= c(pulled_bb[3]+0.05) & lon >= c(pulled_bb[1]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(time =  input_times[,5] == 1) %>% 
  hyper_tibble(select_var = input_variables) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326, agr = "constant")

tail(Pulled_data_sub1)
tail(Pulled_data_sub2)
```

```{r rbind pulled results from large area, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Pulled_data_stitch <- bind_rows(Pulled_data_sub1, Pulled_data_sub2)

```

### Time extent plot
Check this plot to make sure you downloaded your entire time series. 
```{r plot stitched data, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
plot(Pulled_data_stitch$time, Pulled_data_stitch$`pr_MIROC5_r1i1p1_rcp85`)
```


# Melt downloaded points into a raster before aggregation
```{r rasterize with stars, cache=TRUE, fig.height=7}
rast <- st_rasterize(Pulled_data_large_area_few_variables) 
plot(rast)

```

# Aggregate downloaded data to different spatial objects


## Aggregate to polygon (faster method)
```{r aggregate to polygon, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
extracted <- st_extract(rast, boundaries_large$geometry) %>% st_as_sf()
names(extracted)[1] <- "nn"
ggplot(data=extracted) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = nn)) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low="thistle2", high="darkred", 
                       guide="colorbar",na.value="white")+
  coord_sf(crs = 4326)
```


## Clip raster with polygon (slower method)
```{r cut out raster with polygon, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
intersection <- st_intersection(x = Pulled_data_large_area_few_variables, y = boundaries_large$geometry)

names(intersection)[1:2] <- c("Precipitation","b")
```


```{r plot of raster mask, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggthemes)
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = intersection, aes(color=Precipitation)) +
  scale_color_continuous(low="thistle2", high="darkred", 
                       guide="colorbar",na.value="white")+

# Filter the results from available_data() to specify which data to actually download.

The code in this section will walk through how to create time and variable filters in order to download data using the available_data function.  

## Filter time

The following code is used to create a filter which will select data from the year 2034.  This filter creates an index which is given the value of 0 for times that are not in year 2034 and a value of 1 for times that are in the year 2034.   
```{r filter time, cache=TRUE}
library(tibble)

# Year 2034
time_min <- 72048
time_max <- 73048

input_times <- inputs$available_times %>% add_column(index = 0) 
input_times[which(inputs$available_times[,1] > time_min & inputs$available_times[,1] < time_max ),3] <- 1

tail(input_times)
```

## Filter variable names

The following code creates a filter to select precipitation data from the emission scenario RCP 8.5 from the Beijing Normal University Earth System Model and the Hadley Global Environmental Model 2.  This is done by filtering by variable, by model, and by scenario using a separate call to the `filter()` function for each filtering step.  
```{r filter variables, cache=TRUE}
input_variables <- inputs$variable_names %>% 
  filter(Variable == "Precipitation") %>% 
  filter(Model == c("Beijing Normal University - Earth System Model", "Hadley Global Environment Model 2 - Earth System 365 (day)")) %>%
  filter(Scenario == c( "RCP 8.5")) %>% 
  pull("Available variable")

input_variables
```


# Establish area of interst (AOI) by bounding box

This code obtains the bounding box from Open Street Map (OSM) for the national parks adjacent to Yellowstone National Park and then manually updates the corners of the bounding box for this region to match the official bounding box from the National Parks Service.  This is done because the bounding box obtained from OSM is larger than the official bounding box from the National Parks Service so this adjustment makes sure that the bounding box for our area of interest matches our desired area of interest.    

```{r bounding box, cache=TRUE}
bb <- getbb("yellowstone")
bb_manual <- bb
bb_manual[1,1] <- -111.15594815937659
bb_manual[1,2] <- -109.8305463801207
bb_manual[2,1] <- 44.12354048271325
bb_manual[2,2] <- 45.11911641599412

my_boundary <- opq(bb_manual) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "boundary", value = "national_park") %>% 
osmdata_sf() 

my_boundary
```

```{r pulled bounding box, cache=TRUE}
boundaries <- my_boundary$osm_multipolygons
pulled_bb <- st_bbox(boundaries)
pulled_bb
```

This code produces a map of the area of interest which can be used to ensure that the bounding box that was previously defined for the data matches our desired area of interest.
```{r plot of area of interest, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8}
basemap <- ggplot(data = boundaries) +
  geom_sf(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_sf_text(aes(label = boundaries$name)) 

basemap
```

# Download data by AOI, filtered times, and filtered variable list

This code downloads precipitation data from the Beijing Normal University Earth System Model and the Hadley Global Environmental Model 2 for emission scenario RCP 8.5 for the year 2034 in the national parks that touch Yellowstone National Park.  First, the `hyper_filter()` function is used to select data from the national parks that touch Yellowstone National Park by filtering both the latitude and longitude coordinates to coordinates within a small delta of the minimum and maximum coordinates of the bounding box that was previously defined.  Then the `hyper_filter()` function is used to filter the data to data from the year 2034 using the time filter that was defined above.  Finally, the `hyper_tibble()` function is used to select the precipitation data from the Beijing Normal University Earth System Model and the Hadley Global Environmental Model 2 for emission scenario RCP 8.5 using the filter that was defined above.   
```{r pulled data, cache=TRUE}

This plot shows the data that were downloaded as red dots for the earliest time in year 2034 over the map of the national parks that touch Yellowstone National Park.  The data are shown for the earliest time in year 2034 because data were downloaded for multiple times so filtering to a single point in time shows the spatial distribution of the downloaded data without having to include each of the times for which data were downloaded. 
```{r check pulled data, cache=TRUE, fig.height=8}
check_filter <- Pulled_data %>% filter(time == min(Pulled_data$time))

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = boundaries, fill = "cornflowerblue") +
 geom_sf(data = check_filter, color = "red", size=0.5) +
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) 
```

# Climate Variables, Summaries, and Comparisons
### Computing new daily climate variables

First, we will download data for the RCP 8.5 emission scenario from the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate - Earth System Model.  This download will select maximum temperature, minimum temperature, eastward wind, and northward wind data within Yellowstone National Park at a single time point.  
```{r temp-midpoint, eval=TRUE}
vars <- inputs$variable_names %>% 
  filter(Variable %in% c("Maximum Temperature", "Minimum Temperature", "Eastward Wind", "Northward Wind")) %>% 
  filter(Scenario %in% c("RCP 8.5")) %>% 
  filter(Model %in% c("Model for Interdisciplinary Research On Climate - Earth System Model" )) %>%
  pull("Available variable")

dat <- inputs$src %>% 
  hyper_filter(lat = lat <= c(pulled_bb_large[4]+0.05) & lat >= c(pulled_bb_large[2]-0.05)) %>% 
  hyper_filter(lon = lon <= c(pulled_bb_large[3]+0.05) & lon >= c(pulled_bb_large[1]-0.05)) %>%
  hyper_filter(time = input_times$`Available times` ==  73048) %>% 
  hyper_tibble(select_var = vars) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326, agr = "constant")

head(dat)
```

The above code produces a list containing the data from the download.  The following code converts the data from a list into a dataframe by first extracting each variable from the list and then producing a dataframe of those variables. 
```{r, eval=TRUE}
tasmax <- dat$`tasmax_MIROC-ESM_r1i1p1_rcp85`
tasmin <- dat$`tasmin_MIROC-ESM_r1i1p1_rcp85`

uas <- dat$`uas_MIROC-ESM_r1i1p1_rcp85`
vas <- dat$`vas_MIROC-ESM_r1i1p1_rcp85`

time <- dat$time

df <- data.frame(time, tasmax, tasmin, uas, vas)

head(df)
```

Now that we have all of the climate parameters for our study region, we can
compute functions of those variables. 
For example, it is common to compute the midpoint of the maximum and minimum 
daily temperature, which we can do using the `mutate` function: 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(tasmid = (tasmax + tasmin) / 2)

head(df)
```

Now we have a new column called `tasmid` that is the midpoint of the maximum
and minumum daily temperature!

Wind speed provides another example of a derived parameter that can be computed 
for each day. 
By default, we have two wind-related parameters: the eastward wind component
(called `uas`) and the northward wind component (called `vas`), both in units of 
meters per second (you can get this information from `cft::argument_reference`). 
Wind speed can be computed from `vas` and `uas` using the Pythagorean theorem: 

$\text{Wind speed} = \sqrt{v_{as}^2 + u_{as}^2}.$

In code: 

```{r wind-speed, eval=TRUE}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(wind_speed = sqrt(vas^2 + uas^2))

head(df)
```


### Computing new climate variable summaries

Sometimes, there are new climate variables that summarize daily data. 
For example, you may want to compute: 

- Last Day of Frost (i.e., last day in spring when min. air temp. < 0 C)
- First Day of Frost (i.e., first day in fall when min. air temp. < 0 C)
- Number of days above or below some threshold (e.g., days with max. air temperature over 40 C, or days with > 1mm of precipitation)
- Growing season length (# days with air temperature > 0 C)

All of these quantities summarize daily data, and require some aggregation time interval which in many cases will be one year. 
As an example, we will compute the growing season length for Wind Cave National Park across all models and emissions scenarios. 
To do this, we first need to define a new column for year, which we will use as a grouping variable: 

```{r get-year, eval=FALSE}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(year = year(date))
```

Now, we want to compute growing season length for each year, model, emissions scenario combination. 

```{r grow-season, eval=FALSE}
growing_seasons <- df %>%
  group_by(rcp, model, year, ensemble) %>%
  summarize(season_length = sum(tasmid > 273.15)) %>%
  ungroup
```

Notice that we used our derived temperature midpoint column `tasmid`, and computed the total (`sum()`) number of days for each group where the temperature midpoint was greater than 0 C (or, 273.15 Kelvin, which are the units of the temperature data).

```{r glimpse-grow-season, eval=FALSE}
growing_seasons
```

Let's visualize the growing season over time for each model and emission scenario:

```{r plot-grow-season, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, eval=FALSE}
growing_seasons %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, season_length, color = rcp, group = model)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = .3) + 
  facet_wrap(~rcp, ncol = 1) + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Growing season length (days)") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("dodgerblue", "red")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## Comparing climate in two time periods

Use the tibble object that is returned from `cft_df()` as an input to
`compare_periods()` to compare climate between a reference and target period. You
may specify the function with which to aggregate your chosen variable as well
as the yearly time period months of the year to include in this calculation.

```{r comps, eval=FALSE}
comps <- compare_periods(df,
                         var1 = "pr",
                         var2 = "tasmax",
                         agg_fun = "mean",
                         target_period = c(2025, 2030),
                         reference_period = c(2020, 2024),
                         months1 = 5:8,
                         months2 = 5:8,
                         scenarios = c("rcp45", "rcp85"))
```

This provides a data frame that can be used to compare the values in the target
and reference period.

```{r glimpse-comps, eval=FALSE}
glimpse(comps)
```

One useful plot shows the difference in the two variables between reference and
target periods:

```{r plot-comps, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 9, eval=FALSE}
title <-  paste("Change from the historical vs. reference period:", 
                comps$reference_period, comps$target_period, sep= "  vs  " )[1]

comps %>%
  dplyr::select(parameter, rcp, model, reference_period, target_period, difference) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = parameter, values_from = difference) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  mutate(rcp = ifelse(rcp == "rcp45", "RCP 4.5", "RCP 8.5")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(pr, tasmax, color = rcp)) + 
  ggtitle(title) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, alpha = .2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, alpha = .2) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = model), segment.size = .3, size = 3) + 
  xlab("Difference in mean daily precipitation (mm)") + 
  ylab("Difference in mean daily max. temperature (C)") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("dodgerblue", "red"), 
                     "Greenhouse gas\ntrajectory") 
```

So, nearly all model runs indicate warming, but the amount of warming varies by 
model and emissions scenario. 
Precipitation increases and decreases are predicted by different models. 

# Advanced Aggregation to Spatial Objects using Open Street Map
## Aggregate to River segment

This code obtains Open Street Map data for rivers in Yellowstone National Park and its adjacent parks and converts it to a spatial format.
```{r pull river data, fig.height=10, cache=TRUE}
river <- opq(bb_manual) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "waterway", value = "river") %>%
  osmdata_sf() 
river
```
The following code extracts the raster data along the river geometry for Yellowstone National Park and its adjacent parks and converts it to a spatial format in R.  
```{r aggregate data to river lines, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
river_sub <- st_buffer(river$osm_lines, 2200)
extracted_river <- st_extract(rast,  river_sub$geometry ) %>% st_as_sf()
head(extracted_river)
colnames(extracted_river)[1] <- "pre"

```

This code generates a plot of the projected humidity in 2040 along the rivers in Yellowstone National Park and its adjacent parks. 
```{r plot river aggregation, fig.height=8, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=extracted_river) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = pre), size=0) +
   coord_sf(crs = 4326, xlim = c(pulled_bb_large[1], pulled_bb_large[3]), 
           ylim = c(pulled_bb_large[2], pulled_bb_large[4]),
           expand = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low="thistle2", high="darkred", 
                       guide="colorbar",na.value="white")+
  labs(title = "Rivers of Yellowstone",
       subtitle = "Projected humidity in 2040", 
       caption = "Data Source: Climate Futures...") + 
  theme_tufte()
```

## Aggregate to road segment

This code is aggregating to road segments in Yellowstone National Park and its adjacent parks in a similar manner to the aggregation to rivers that was performed above.  First, we obtain the Open Street Map data of road segments in Yellowstone National Park and its adjacent parks and convert the open street map data into a spatial format.  Then the humidity data from the raster is extracted along the road segment geometry in Yellowstone National Park and its adjacent parks and this data is converted to a spatial format.  
```{r pull road data, fig.height=8, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
roads <- opq(pulled_bb_large) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = 'highway', value = 'primary') %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = 'highway', value = 'secondary') %>%
  osmdata_sf() 
roads_sub <- st_buffer(roads$osm_lines, 2200)
extracted_roads <- st_extract(rast,  roads_sub$geometry ) %>% st_as_sf()
extracted_roads

colnames(extracted_roads)[1] <- "pre"
```

The following code produces a plot of the projected humidity in 2040 along the road segments in Yellowstone National Park and its adjacent parks.
```{r plot road aggregation, fig.height=8, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=extracted_roads) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = pre), size=0) +
   coord_sf(crs = 4326) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low="thistle2", high="darkred", 
                       guide="colorbar",na.value="white")+
  labs(title = "Roads of Yellowstone",
       subtitle = "Projected humidity in 2040", 
       caption = "Data Source: Climate Futures...") + 
  theme_tufte()
```
